- 👋 Hi, I’m @TonyAdornato
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching myself how to code in Python. In my current job I work as an automation engineer working with Durr paint robots. I do a lot of coding in my job but most of it is in Ecotalk(robot programming language). I would like to expand my skills to include Python. The projects you see here are all based around that idea.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything quite yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: tony.adornato@gmail.com
